# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction Hackathon

Build a machine learning-powered web application that predicts flight delays using GitHub Copilot as your AI pair programmer.

## 🎯 What You'll Build

An end-to-end application where users can:
- Select a day of the week and destination airport
- Get the probability of their flight being delayed by more than 15 minutes
- See color-coded risk levels in a modern web interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Data Science** | Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn |
| **Backend** | Flask REST API |
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **AI Pair Programmer** | GitHub Copilot |

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio Code** with the following extensions:
  - GitHub Copilot (required)
  - Python Extension
  - Jupyter Extension
- **Python 3.9+** with pip
- **Git** for cloning the repository

## 📊 Dataset

The `data/flights.csv` contains 271,000+ FAA flight records from 2013 with delay information, carrier codes, and airport details. Perfect for binary classification.

## 📖 Hackathon Structure
